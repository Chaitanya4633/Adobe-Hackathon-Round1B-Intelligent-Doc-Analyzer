# üìò Adobe Hackathon - Round 1B: Intelligent Document Analyzer

## üß† Challenge Theme: ‚ÄúConnect What Matters ‚Äî For the User Who Matters‚Äù

This repository contains our solution for Round 1B of Adobe's "Connecting the Dots" hackathon challenge. Our system analyzes a collection of documents and extracts **the most relevant sections** based on a defined **persona** and their **job-to-be-done**.

## üöÄ Problem Statement

Given:
- A set of PDFs (3‚Äì10 documents)
- A persona (e.g., researcher, student, analyst)
- A job-to-be-done (e.g., literature review, summarization)

> üìå Objective: Identify and rank the **most relevant sections** and **sub-sections** from the documents that align with the persona‚Äôs goal.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Extract text content from all PDFs.
   - Detect and normalize headings and paragraphs using layout and font analysis.

2. **Persona Understanding:**
   - Parse the persona and job-to-be-done into a keyword vector using embeddings.

3. **Section Relevance Ranking:**
   - Compare each section‚Äôs content with the persona-task vector using cosine similarity (via TF-IDF or sentence transformers).
   - Assign importance ranks based on match score.

4. **Sub-section Analysis:**
   - Drill down into sub-paragraphs within the top-ranked sections for deeper relevance extraction.

5. **Output JSON:**
   - Generates structured JSON with metadata, ranked sections, and refined sub-sections.
